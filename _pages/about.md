I am a WASP Academic PhD student at  KTH Royal Institute of Technology, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Division of Software and Computer Systems. I am working on Probabilistic Programming Languages (PPLs) and my supervisor is David Broman. 
My research focuses on deep probabilistic programming languages and their application on clinical data.
